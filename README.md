The aim is to predict whether a given banknote is authentic or counterfeit using Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Perceptron Learning
After comparison it is concluded that the KNN & SVM algorithms are the best algorithms for banknote authentication with an accuracy of 100% & 99.45%.
